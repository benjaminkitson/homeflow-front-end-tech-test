The Homeflow front-end devloper tech test!

Homeflow provided a very open-ended briefy, supplying an ultra-lightweight Sinatra back-end that returns JSON data from their API, and giving me free reign to create whatever I'd like from that. I've created a React app that returns a list of properties based on a user's search input, as well as some filters to help them narrow down their search. 

Thanks very much to Homeflow for giving me the opportunity, and for creating a test that's creative and fun to work on!
